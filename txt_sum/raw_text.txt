Here is a shocker from Haryana. The State Government has handed out cheques for as little as Re.1, Rs.2 and Rs.3 to farmers in neighbouring Mewat as compensation for crop damage last year.

The meagre compensation has caused resentment among farmers who will now have to shell out several hundred rupees to open accounts in banks to encash the cheques. Some of the farmers reportedly tore the cheques in protest.

The compensation has been granted for crops damaged in hailstorm in January-February last year. “The compensation has been decided based on a Revenue Department survey of affected villages. We have been entrusted with the task of distributing close to 3,000 cheques in 14 villages in Mewat. The compensation cheques have been handed over to more than 300 beneficiaries so far. Some of the cheques are for as little as Re.1, Rs.2, Rs.12 and Rs.50 and similar amounts,” said an Agriculture Department official at the block-level.
